As for this project, you have a lot of freedom to implement it.
You can use the cubes defined during exercise lessons with different diffuse colours, or also
add textures you like on them.
You can use a scaled cube also for the paddle. As for the ball, again you can use the sphere used 
during exercise lessons. We provided a texture you can use for the background if you want.
Please use at least one texture for the project.
